### Things to be considered

- Template block is given as *task4sim.slx*, parameters are given as *parameters.mat* and world file as *World_LUT* .
- Load parameters and world file before running task.
- Use the Density of the Chassis and the wheel as 300 and 5000, respectively (default units), wherever necessary.
- The range of sensors is 500 mm.
- Sensor data is built in an array of size 8.
- Find the sensor positions with respect to the virtual world and write the control algorithm for obstacle avoidance.
- Using StateFlow is optional for writing control algorithm.
- Initial default motion for the bot should be right for 5 sec and total simulation time must be 100 sec.

### Submission Instructions
- On the screen recorder, run the simulation.
