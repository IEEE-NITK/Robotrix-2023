### Thingsto be considered
- Template block is given as task3sim.slx and parameters are given as parameters.mat.
- Load parameters before starting the task.
- Use the Density of the Chassis and the wheel as 300 and 5000, respectively (default units), wherever necessary.
- Bot should be linked with the world frame with necessary blocks.
- Kinematics block should be added to get the required motion of the bot in the world frame.

### Submission Instructions
