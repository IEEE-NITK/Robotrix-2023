### Things to be considered:
- Template block is given as *task1sim.slx*.
- For dimensions open assembly file in fusionFiles folder.([Method for accessing .f3z files](https://fileinfo.com/extension/f3z#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20F3Z%20files,to%20view%20and%20edit%20them))
- Use the Density of the Chassis and the wheel as 300 and 5000, respectively (default units), wherever necessary.
- The jointâ€™s z-axis should be aligned so that the wheels' forward rotation should be positive.
- Velocity should be extracted from the joint block for each wheel and should be named as wtopRight, wtopLeft, wbottomRight, wbottomLeft for successful auto evaluator run.
### Submission Instructions:
- Turn on Screen Recorder and run *task1Check* in matlab command line.
- Stop the screen recording once the simulation is completed with a success message.
- Submission folder should consist:
1. Matlab Files
2. Fusion Files
3. Screen Recorded Video named as *task1video_Teamname*.
- Compress the submission folder and name it as *task1_teamname*.
- Submit the compressed folder in the following link:
